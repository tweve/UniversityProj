Suggestions, criticism etc.
---------------------------
This is in many ways an educational project for me. It is the first official project designed to
be used by others, it is the first project using unittests to test the project,
it is the first project released to support several Python versions,
it is the first project to be released with a complete documentation. I am also still learning to
program in Python as I go.

Because of this, I will me more than happy to hear suggestions about what could be done better or
more efficiently and how the quality of the package could be improved.

If you have any suggestions on how the code or any of the Meta data in the project could be
improved, please don't hesitate to contact me at fuzzycomp@googlegroups.com.
