        Included Algorithms
        ===================
        
        String comparison:
        
          * Levenshtein Distance
          * Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
          * Jaro Distance
          * Jaro-Winkler Distance
          * Match Rating Approach Comparison
          * Hamming Distance
        
        Phonetic encoding:
        
          * American Soundex
          * Metaphone
          * NYSIIS (New York State Identification and Intelligence System)
          * Match Rating Codex
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        >>> import jellyfish
        >>> jellyfish.levenshtein_distance('jellyfish', 'smellyfish')
        2
        >>> jellyfish.jaro_distance('jellyfish', 'smellyfish')
        0.89629629629629637
        >>> jellyfish.damerau_levenshtein_distance('jellyfish', 'jellyfihs')
        1
        
        >>> jellyfish.metaphone('Jellyfish')
        'JLFX'
        >>> jellyfish.soundex('Jellyfish')
        'J412'
        >>> jellyfish.nysiis('Jellyfish')
        'JALYF'
        >>> jellyfish.match_rating_codex('Jellyfish')
        'JLLFSH'
